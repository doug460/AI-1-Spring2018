----------- COMPILE ------------
All files need to be in same folder

Update the inputs.py file to change the inputs to the search algorithms

All search algorithms use the same intputs.py file

To run a search algorithm, type...
	python foo.py
	
	ie:
	python breadthFirst.py
	python depthFirst.py
	

----------- ADDING NODE ------------
General expansion of node is moving empty space in the following order and adding to frontier
	up
	down
	left
	right


----------- BREADTH FIRST ------------
To use, simply run the python code

Inputs are defined in inputs.py 

Output:
	goal state and initial state
	Then when a node is popped or added
	When a successful node is reached
	The number of nodes in the fringe and the number of nodes expanded
	
	
----------- DEPTH FIRST ------------
Same as Breadth first


----------- ITERATIVE DEEEPENING ------------
Output:
	Runs the depth first search algorithm with limited depth
	Shows when the depth is increased and when all the nodes in a particular layer have been evaluated
	
	
----------- A* ------------
Output:
	includes the cost associated with each node when it is added to the fringe
