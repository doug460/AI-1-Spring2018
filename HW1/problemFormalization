Problem Formalization


Initial State: 
	Defined in code. ie: 187932456*
	
States:
	9!

Actions:
	Top, Bottom, Left, Right
	These actions switch the Up, Bottom,... block with the empty * space
	
Transition Model:
	Array is indexed starting at zero and increases similarly as the lab handout
	index of * is E
		Top: swap [E,E-3] 
		Bottom: swap [E,E+3]
		Left: swap [E,E-1]
		Right: swap [E,E+1]
	
	assuming [A,B] where A,B < 8
	
Goal:
	*12345678
	
Goal Test:
	If state s = G
	
Path Cost:
	Each step costs 1
